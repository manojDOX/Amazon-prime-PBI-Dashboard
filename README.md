## 🗃️ Dataset Description

Two CSV files were used in this project, combining both categorical and numerical data:

### 📁 titles.csv
- `id`, `title`, `show_type`, `release_year`, `description`, `age_certification`
- `runtime`, `genres`, `production_countries`, `seasons`
- `imdb_id`, `imdb_score`, `imdb_votes`, `tmdb_score`, `tmdb_popularity`

### 📁 credits.csv
- `person_ID`, `id`, `name`, `character_name`, `role` (ACTOR or DIRECTOR)

🔢 **Data Stats**:
- 9617 Titles  
- 124K+ Credits  
- 15 Fields (titles), 5 Fields (credits)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Performed using **Power Query**:
- Removed duplicates and nulls  
- Normalized `genres` and `production_countries` into separate relational tables  
- Split list fields using `Text.Split`  
- Converted types for scoring, dates, etc.

---

## 🧠 Data Modeling

- Star schema used in Power BI  
- One-to-many: `titles[id]` → `credits[id]`  
- Flattened many-to-many relationships for genres & countries  
- Created custom measures and calculated columns

---

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures

```dax
Total Titles = COUNT(titles[id])
Total Movies = CALCULATE(COUNT(titles[id]), titles[show_type] = "MOVIE")
Total Shows = CALCULATE(COUNT(titles[id]), titles[show_type] = "SHOW")

Avg IMDb Score = AVERAGE(titles[imdb_score])
Avg TMDB Score = AVERAGE(titles[tmdb_score])
Total IMDb Votes = SUM(titles[imdb_votes])
```

## 🎨 Dashboard Design Highlights

- **KPI Cards**: Ratings, votes, content counts  
- **Charts**: Line (score over time), Bar (genre scores), Pie (content ratio), Scatter (talent), Map (top producing countries)  
- **Theme**: Dark UI with blue accents  
- **UX**: Slicers, filters, intuitive layout

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Avg IMDb Score: 5.96  
- Documentaries lead in average scores  
- USA, UK, and India produce the most content  
- Shows only 12.7% of the content  
- Directors show stronger correlation with higher IMDb scores

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Handling multi-value categorical fields  
- Creating normalized structure without losing filtering ability  
- Making the design compact but informative

---

## 🔮 Conclusion

The dashboard provides meaningful insights into Prime Video's content library and audience preferences. It showcases real-world data modeling, visualization techniques, and storytelling using Power BI.
